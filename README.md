# Neural style transfer with CycleGAN

This repository contains a **Tensorflow** implementation and demonstration of **CycleGAN** technique. 

The technique performs unpaired image to image translation using conditional GAN's.  It can be trained to translate instances from one domain to another without a one-to-one mapping between the source and target domain.

CycleGAN can be used to solve many interesting problems such as photo-enhancement, image colorization, style transfer, etc. The capabilities are demonstrated in two tasks:
- translation of handwritten digits
- style transfer based on paintings by Leonid Afremov
